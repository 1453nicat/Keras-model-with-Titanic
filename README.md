# Keras-model-with-Titanic
Project using Titanic dataset


# Overview
This project predicts survival on the Titanic using the famous Titanic Dataset. It demonstrates preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization using the Keras deep learning library.

# Features
Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and train-test split.
Deep Learning Model: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) built with Keras.
Metrics: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to evaluate model performance.
Early Stopping: Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Visualization: Provides insights into model training through loss and accuracy plots.

# Libraries
- zipfile
- missingno
- pandas: for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn: for data visualization
- sklearn: for machine learning
- scipy: for statistical analysis
- keras: for deep learning
